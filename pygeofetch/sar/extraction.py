"""
GRDExtractor — extract and correctly georeference a Sentinel-1 GRD
measurement band from a downloaded .SAFE.zip.

GRD products carry a single continuous measurement band per polarisation
(unlike SLC's 3 sub-swaths), so this is a simpler extraction than
SLCExtractor — but it needs the same real-world handling SLCExtractor
already applies: the raw measurement TIFF inside the .SAFE archive
commonly has NO standard CRS/transform at all (src.crs is None, and its
"bounds" are just raw pixel indices). Real georeferencing is instead
delivered as embedded Ground Control Points (GCPs). Skipping this step
doesn't raise an error — downstream operations like clip() can appear to
succeed while actually operating on a meaningless few pixels near the
raster's origin, unrelated to your real AOI. This was found and fixed
directly against a real Sentinel-1 GRD product during development, not
assumed.

Usage::

    from pygeofetch.sar import GRDExtractor

    extractor = GRDExtractor(polarisation="VV")
    vv_path = extractor.extract_band(download_result, output_dir="./data", label="pre_event")
    # vv_path is a real, properly-georeferenced GeoTIFF, ready for
    # Preprocessor.clip() / SARProcessor.calibrate()

    """
    Georeference a raster via its embedded Ground Control Points, if it
    doesn't already have a real CRS.

    Raw Sentinel-1 measurement TIFFs (both GRD and SLC) commonly carry no
    standard CRS/transform — real georeferencing is delivered as embedded
    GCPs instead. Rasters that already have a real CRS are returned
    completely unchanged; this is safe to call on any raster
    unconditionally, not just ones known to need it.

    Returns:
        The original path if it already had a real CRS or had no GCPs to
        fall back on (in which case a warning is logged — downstream
        clipping will not work correctly against it); otherwise the path
